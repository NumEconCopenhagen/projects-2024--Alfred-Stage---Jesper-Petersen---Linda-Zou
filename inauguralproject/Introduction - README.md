# Inaugural project

The inauguaral project is based on an exhange economy between two consumers, who trade their endowments in order to maximize their own utility. In order to see how consumer A and B behave, we have observed differences in their behaviour under different assumptions.

We have a simple set-up with one workbook and on pyfile, which is structured as a class, which contains multiple functions. 

Note: Everything should be able to run without any additional downloads of function packages
