# Model Project

**ATTENTION:** <br>
- ipywidgets and IPython.display must be downloaded on computer in order to display figures. <br>
- Files need to be downloaded and opened in Visual Code Studiio in order to see figures due to sliders! <br>
- Our project uses numpy, matplotlib, ipywidgets, types, scipy, sympy, IPython.display and the underlying installations used in this course <br>

Our model project is based on the "Solow Growth Model" for an open economy.

The project focuses on the transistion to steady state, development in underlying variables and the time to steady state. 
Additionally, our project analyze what happens, when shocks in exogenous variables mean for the open economy. 
Lastly, we have added a simple shock factor from nettoexports, which shows how the inflation rates, interest rates and exchange rates indirectly effect out steady state and convergence. 



Our teaching assistant had trouble with the loadingtime of our widgets, but our (regular) computers were able to run the code in less than 2 seconds plus an external computer also had no trouble. Please contact us if any problems occur. Key thing, from our experience, is to download files, run both py-files in VS code, and to have pip-installed the two relevant packages.
