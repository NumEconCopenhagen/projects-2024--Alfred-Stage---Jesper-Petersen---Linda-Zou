# Model analysis project

Our model project is based on the "Solow Growth Model" for an open economy.

The project focuses on the transistion to steady state, development in underlying variables and the time to steady state. 
Additionally, our project analysis what happens, when shocks in exogenous variables mean for the open economy. 
Lastly, we have added a simple shock factor from nettoexports, which shows how the inflation rates, interest rates and exchange rates indirectly effect out steady state and convergence.
