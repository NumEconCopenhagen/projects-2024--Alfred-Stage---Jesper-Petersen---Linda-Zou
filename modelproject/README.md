# Model analysis project

**ATTENTION:** <br>
- ipywidgets shall be downloaded on computer in order to display figures. <br>
- Files need to be downloaded in order to see figures due to sliders! <br>
- Our project uses numpy, matplotlib, ipywidgets, types, scipy, sympy, IPython.display and the underlying installations used in this course <br>

Our model project is based on the "Solow Growth Model" for an open economy.

The project focuses on the transistion to steady state, development in underlying variables and the time to steady state. 
Additionally, our project analyze what happens, when shocks in exogenous variables mean for the open economy. 
Lastly, we have added a simple shock factor from nettoexports, which shows how the inflation rates, interest rates and exchange rates indirectly effect out steady state and convergence.
