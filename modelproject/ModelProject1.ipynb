    "over the long term growth path. <br> <br>\n",
    "Our nettoexport shock model, however, also tells a more nuanced story about the competitive advantageses and disadvantageses followed by the parameter changes. An example of this is the effect of the domestic inflationrate,
    "which can cause a negative shock if the economy is overheating, due to increased accumulation and activity. Also illustrated is the dynamic of open markets, wherein the economy benefits from having a lower domestic inflationrate,
    "compared to the simplified overall foreign inflationrate."
